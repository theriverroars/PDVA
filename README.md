# Dynamic Vibration Absorber with MR Damper

This repository contains the **experimental data, data processing scripts, simulation models, and final report** for the **Dynamic Vibration Absorber (DVA) project**.

## üìñ Project Overview

The project investigates the performance of a **passive Dynamic Vibration Absorber (DVA)** integrated with a **Magnetorheological (MR) Damper**.

* The **MR Damper** provides tunable damping properties by varying the applied current.
* By integrating it with the DVA, the system exhibits **adaptive vibration absorption behavior** under different operating conditions.
* A proposed **Partial Dynamic Vibration Absorber (PDVA)** design is analyzed to evaluate improvements in vibration control.

Do you want me to make it more **academic/paper-style** (with references, equations, etc.) or more **portfolio-style** (to showcase your work to recruiters)?
