This is a repository for all the experimental data collected, processinng and final report for the work on Dynamic Vibration Absorber project.

Cleaned Data.zip has the relevant data with which analysis for proposed Partial Dynamic Vibration Absorber is performed. the details on the mechanical design and modelling of the PDVA is available in the report.

The mathematical simulationin simulink is attached as a Simulink file.
